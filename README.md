                                            RPG BOT NOTES

- xp is only gained through PvP
- leveling up increases attack and health
- bot health might scale in the future(?)
- PvBot to be added before PvP
- xp gained should be random depending on opponent's level (Ex. high level opponents give more xp if defeated)
- a campaign for users to go through to earn items/xp from bosses(?)
- randomly generated enemies for farming items such as healing items(?)
- at least 10 different items to start(?)
- inventory slot limit(?)
- there should be a limit on how many items can be stacked at once (maybe 5?)
- a shop with money(?)
- events that occur randomly(?)
- need to figure out how to code the 'waiting for reactions' in order to allow challenged users to accept/decline PvP
